# Prework Study Guide WebPage

## Description

I wanted to learn the basics of web design and Git Hub, as well as aquire the neccessary software, to help prepare me for my upcoming coding bootcamp course. I built this website as a guide to help me along the way and to provide me with practice. This prework page will give me a quick, structured place to find my prework notes as I progress, and will offer a good sandbox for me to practice my skills. Through making this site I have learned the basics of Git, Git Hub, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Installation

## Usage

This site contains notes on topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It can be used to store further notes in the future, and act as a place to practice anything learned from the coding bootcamp or outside of it. It will offer a topic to study first from a list of learned topics.
